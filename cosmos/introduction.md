# Cosmos
Cosmos is a utility extension built in AL language, designed to provide reusable functionality for multiple dependent extensions within the Business Central ecosystem.
## Overview
This repository serves as a centralized hub for essential code components that are commonly required by various Business Central applications. By consolidating such code into Cosmos, developers can mitigate redundancy and streamline development processes across different applications.
## Problem Statement
In the development of Business Central applications, developers often encounter the need to implement certain functionalities that are fundamental and recurrent across multiple apps. However, the traditional approach of duplicating this code for each application leads to inefficiency, maintenance challenges, and potential inconsistencies. The absence of a centralized repository for such common code exacerbates these issues, hindering developers from effectively leveraging existing solutions.
## Goals/Objectives
- **Centralization**: Establish a centralized repository for essential code components, ensuring easy access and maintenance for developers.
- **Redundancy Reduction**: Eliminate redundancy by consolidating common functionalities into Cosmos, reducing code duplication across multiple Business Central applications.
- **Streamlined Development**: Facilitate faster development cycles by providing a single source of truth for reusable code, enabling developers to focus on app-specific features.
- **Consistency**: Ensure consistency across Business Central applications by promoting the use of standardized code components from Cosmos, thus enhancing overall code quality and reliability.
